# Agentic AI Data Analysis Assistant

An autonomous, agent-driven data analysis system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to inspect datasets, plan analysis steps, generate insights, visualize results, and perform self-review.

This project demonstrates **agentic AI principles** applied to real-world data analytics workflows.

## 🧠 Agentic Architecture

The system is composed of modular agents:

1. **Inspection Agent** – Analyzes dataset structure and quality  
2. **Planning Agent** – Decides analysis steps using an LLM  
3. **Analysis Agent** – Computes descriptive statistics  
4. **Visualization Agent** – Generates plots for numeric features  
5. **Insight Agent** – Converts statistics into readable insights  
6. **Self-Review Agent** – Evaluates insight quality and usefulness  

This mirrors enterprise **agentic AI systems** used for analytics, automation, and decision support.
